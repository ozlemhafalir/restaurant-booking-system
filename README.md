So much time has been spent for planning and carefully designing the user experience (including learning how to use the tool).

According to design, the Django project has been initiated, applications are created, models are defined. Landing and restaurant detail pages are implemented.

The models are also registered to admin application.

Unfortunately, this application has not been deployed to a cloud, hence, no demo is available so far.
